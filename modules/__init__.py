# This is an empty file placed here for the purpose of making sure Python finds this "module" folder easily. A directory becomes a package only when it contains  
# __init__.py. Without that marker Python still finds the directory (thanks to “namespace packages” added in Python 3.3), but the behaviour can be flaky.  Dropping in 
# __init__.py makes it unambiguous.
